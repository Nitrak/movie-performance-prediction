# movie-performance-prediction
Part of the code of the bachelor project of Per Josefsen and Michael Vesterli for using deep neural networks to predict the performance of movies in cinemas. Includes the code for running and evaluating models. Note that since not all of our data can be publicized, the models cannot be run.
